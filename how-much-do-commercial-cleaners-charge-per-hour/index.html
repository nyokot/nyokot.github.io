<meta name="description" content="Are you wondering how much commercial cleaners charge per hour? Whether you are a business owner or someone looking for cleaning services, it&#39;s important to know the average cost of hiring commercial cleaners. Many people think that commercial cleaning services are expensive, but the truth is that the cost can vary depending on several factors such as the size of the space, the type of cleaning required, and the location of the business. The average cost of hiring commercial cleaners can range from $20 to $50 per hour. However, this can go up for larger businesses or for specialized cleaning services such as carpet or window cleaning.
