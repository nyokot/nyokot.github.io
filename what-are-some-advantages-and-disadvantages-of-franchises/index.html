One of the biggest advantages of owning a franchise is the built-in brand recognition.

Additionally, franchise fees and royalties can eat into your profits, making it difficult to grow your business.What are Franchises?Franchises are essentially a type of business model where a franchisor licenses their brand and business model to a franchisee.
